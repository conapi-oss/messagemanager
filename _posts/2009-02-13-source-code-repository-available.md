The source code for message manager has always been available inside the jarfile, but this was never a very easy way to get the code for anyone. I have converted the subversion repository to [mercurial](http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/) in order to be able to publish it on the web site, history and all.

You may access the repository at <http://queuemanager.nl/hg/> and clone it from the same URL. The project is also up on Ohloh [here](https://www.ohloh.net/p/sonicmessagemanager).
