Pending some major changes in the trunk, I&#8217;ve switched the nightly build over to a separate 1.4 branch. This is also reflected in the nightly build version number. This means that the 1.x branch will not receive any more new features until the 2.0 release later this year. Unless someone submits a patch for 1.x or a change is requested by a customer.

Version 1.4 will be released as soon as enough people have tested the nightly build and have not found any serious issues. When no bugs have to be fixed, version 1.4 will be released on friday june 2oth.
