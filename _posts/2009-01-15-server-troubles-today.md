What should have been a simple server upgrade turned out to be quite the nightmare. As a result, this site has been offline for about 8 hours. Some people may have had trouble starting or updating SMM as a result. The trouble has been resolved now and everything should work as advertised.

If something turns out not to work, please e-mail me at gdr at progaia-rsAABBCC dot nl. (remove the upper-case characters from the address, they are for spam protection).
