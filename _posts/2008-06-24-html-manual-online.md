The manual for Sonic Message Manager has been updated to HTML format and is now viewable online at <http://queuemanager.nl/smmmanual>. You may also click on the &#8220;Manual&#8221; link at the far right of this page. There is also a multi-page HTML edition at <http://queuemanager.nl/smmbook>.

The manual is generated from the nightly build sources, so it may contain features not yet available in the stable releases of SMM. Future versions will have this manual built-in as on-line help.
