The mailing list has been improved to allow anyone to subscribe and unsubscribe themselves without having to ask me first. The mailing list software I&#8217;m running is majordomo for those of you who are unfamiliar with it, here are the important commands:

To subscribe send an e-mail message containing only the words &#8220;subscribe smm-user&#8221; in the message body to majordomo@queuemanager.nl to subscribe to the mailing list. You will receive a confirmation e-mail. To unsubscribe send &#8220;unsubscribe smm-user&#8221;, you will also receive confirmation.

Anything you e-mail to smm-user@queuemanager.nl will be sent to all members of the list and anyone is able to reply. Announcements will be made as messages to this list.
