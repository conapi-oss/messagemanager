Version 1.1 of the Sonic Message Manager has been released just prior to my vacation. This version contains the following changes:

  * Select a directory to send all files in that directory
  * Improved errorhandling
  * Asynchronous queue browsing
  * Save message with extension based on messagetype
  * Format xml messages / parts before viewing in browser

All other features (like those outlined in the upcoming features post some time ago) have been postponed until v1.2 because of time constraints. The message manager will not be updated in the coming few weeks. Expect the next update (version 1.2) some time in april. Please post feature requests and bugs in a comment.
