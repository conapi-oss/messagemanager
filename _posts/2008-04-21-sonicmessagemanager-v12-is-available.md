SonicMessageManager v1.2 has been released and contains the following new features/bugfixes:

  * Multi select for queues. You can now select multiple queues at the same time to clear messages.
  * Auto refresh for message counts. The message count will now refresh automatically every few seconds.
  * The last used directory for saving or opening a message file will now be remembered
  * The connection tab now allows you to delete saved connections.

All current users will get the update pushed to them through Java Web Start. If you built the program from source code, you will have to update it yourself.
