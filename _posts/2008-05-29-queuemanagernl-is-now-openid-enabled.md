You may now post comments while logged in with your OpenID, this will automatically approve your comment as well! For more information about OpenID and how to get one, please visit [OpenID.net](http://openid.net).

PS. I&#8217;m trying to release version 1.4 before the Progress Exchange in a week. Please help me test the nightly build to get it stable.
