I just released Sonic Message Manager 1.6, these are it&#8217;s most important changes and new features:

  * 79: Include manual as on-line help
  * 92: Add SonicMQ.deadMessage to the queue list
  * 93: Add viewing of JMSCorrelationID in hex

Please enjoy it and keep sending in suggestions for improvements, preferably through the mailing list so others can also comment on your input.
