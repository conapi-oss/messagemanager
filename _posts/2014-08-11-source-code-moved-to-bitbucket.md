To resolve issues with people trying to get access to the source code of Sonic Message Manager, I moved it to Bitbucket. I&#8217;m also using their issue tracker now instead of using a local instance of Trac. This means that the source code is now available at:

<https://bitbucket.org/gerco/messagemanager-2.x>

And the issue tracker is available at:

<https://bitbucket.org/gerco/messagemanager-2.x/issues>

I copied all open issues from the old Trac database to the Bitbucket issue tracker. Since this was a manual process, I may have missed some information and some triage will need to be done to make sure all is ok.

Please create any missing issues, fork, code and create pull requests as you see fit.
