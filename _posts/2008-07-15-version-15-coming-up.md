I know I told you all that there would not likely be a version 1.5, I was wrong. Several people have requested the following features to be added and I didn&#8217;t want to wait for 2.0 to make them happy.

  * (#83) Configurable message sending delay. This will allow you to send messages with a (small) delay and will let you perform simple performance tests without soaking the ESB with a large amount of messages at a much-too-high rate.
  * (#84) Sonic 7.6 support.

Version 1.5 will appear when it&#8217;s done but I&#8217;m aiming to release it this month. In the mean time, the nightly build process has been switched to the 1.x branch and #83 has already been implemented. Feel free to test it and report bugs and suggestions.
