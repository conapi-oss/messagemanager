As of now, Sonic Message Manager 2.0 is feature complete and it will enter beta stage now. I urge everyone to try the nightly build because of this. 

Everything in there should work as expected and without errors. If it does not, please inform me of the problems. Without major issues, Sonic Message Manager 2.0 will be released one week from today.
