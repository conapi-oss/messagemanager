I just released version 1.3 of Sonic Message Manager. This release contains the following changes (among some minor bugfixes):

  * Text messages are now formatted as Xml if possible;
  * The broker selection combo box only displays brokers that are started and on-line;
  * Improved message sending speed, particularly on high-latency networks.

This release has also be posted on the [Sonic Code Share](http://www.psdn.com/library/thread.jspa?threadID=9922&messageID=30348) so feel free to download it and send me your patches to the source code. Please report any problems you may have or features you would like to see in the comments or e-mail me directly.
