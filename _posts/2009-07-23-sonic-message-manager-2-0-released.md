It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve released a new version of Sonic Message Manager, but I hope this was worth the wait. The new 2.0 version introduces Topic support and also fixes the following issues:

  * 87: Auto-refreshing the queues now works on all tabs
  * 113: Allow connecctions to multiple brokers at the same time
  * 114: Switching connections doesn&#8217;t always work
  * 120: Allow the user to specify TimeToLive when sending messages
  * 132: Clear broker combobox while changing connection
  * 133: Disconnect button
  * 134: Can&#8217;t see manual when starting SMM
  * 135: Merge about tab with help tab
  * 138: Copy (or drag) multiple queues to a text editor

Aside from these recorded changes, there are also a massive amount of small things that didn&#8217;t get a mention in here. I hope you will enjoy the new version!
