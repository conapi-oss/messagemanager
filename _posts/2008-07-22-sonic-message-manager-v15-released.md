Sonic Message Manager v1.5 has been released moments ago. The following changes have been made (apart from the usual small bugfixes present in every release):

  * 83: Configurable message sending delay
  * 84: Sonic 7.6 support
  * 86: XML Messages with non-Xml content weren&#8217;t being displayed properly

Have fun with it!
