Message Manager uses Java Modules for classloading. This may cause issues with some providers that do not fully support this yet.

You need to ensure the classpath of the profile only contains the required jars.

After the installation of Message Manager, Example/Template profiles are created.

These profiles usually list the required jars in the classpath.



For example, for SonicMQ you select the "Aurea Messenger / SonicMQ - TEMPLATE" profile and take a look at the classpath field.

 

You may select all these jars from the template, copy the references to the clipboard, then remove the path to only have one  filename per line.

I have this already in my clipboard.



Then navigate back to your profile.

Select all jars and press the "Remove Jar" button.

Then click "Add jar".

Navigate to the folder where the jars are located.

Now either select them one by one or paste the jar list from your clipboard.

Press OK



Once you have added the required jars, you have to double check that the classpath field contains only the required jars.

Sometimes additional jars are added because they are referenced in the JAR manifest file.

Remove any wrong or duplicate entries.
