## What is a Profile?
A profile is a configuration that defines the type of messaging system and the libraries used to work with a specific message broker or messaging system.
i.e. You can have a Kafka profile, a Solace profile, and so on. Each profile represents a different messaging system.
You can create multiple profiles of the same type, allowing you to use different client libraries and versions for each profile.

## Profile Selection
To connect to a specific broker, select the appropriate profile from the list the main interface.

## Profile Creation and Duplication
To create a new or to duplicate an existing profile:

1. Select the profile you want to duplicate.
2. Click on the "Duplicate Profile" button.
3. Enter a new name for the duplicated profile.
4. Verify the library versions you want to use.

## Profile Deletion and Reset
To delete a profile:
1. Select the profile you want to delete.
2. Click on the "Remove Profile" button and confirm the action.

To reset a profile to its default settings:
1. Select the profile you want to reset.
2. Click on the "Remove Profile" button.
3. After the next restart the default/template profile will be loaded.

## Classpath Configuration
For the open-source version, you may need to manually configure the classpath to include the necessary broker-specific libraries.

For the commercial version, the classpath is automatically configured based on the selected profile, ensuring all required libraries are loaded.
You can also manually configure the classpath if necessary.
