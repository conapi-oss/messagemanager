MESSAGE MANAGER

The scripts in this folder will be replaced on each update. You can add JVM options by creating a setenv.cmd/sh file.

Please use launch.cmd/sh to start message manager.

LAUNCHER ONLY:

In case you only downloaded the launcher it is important to have a Java 17 JRE/JDK set as JAVA_HOME.
Or you have to rename setenv.*.template to setenv.cmd/sh and set the pat to the JVM there
The remaining JAR files will be downloaded automatically.
