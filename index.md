The Sonic™ Message Manager is an application aimed at replacing the JMS Test Client provided with Sonic™ MQ for general use. It will not support the most advanced features of the JMS Test Client, but will provide other features that the JMS Test Client lacks.

## Features

  * Automatically discovers brokers in the connected Sonic™ Domain
  * Lists queues on the selected broker to prevent needless typing
  * Delete all message from a queue
  * Deleting messages anywhere on a queue
  * Drag (multiple) messages from one queue to another
  * Send messages by dragging files on to a queue
  * Send one message multiple times
  * Set JMSCorrelationID and JMSReplyTo on outgoing messages
  * Set custom Header Properties on test message
  * Copy/drag a message part to another queue or a program
  * Re-uses connections from the Sonic™ Management Console
  * Displays every part of a multi-part message separately
  * Includes hex-viewer for BytesMessages
